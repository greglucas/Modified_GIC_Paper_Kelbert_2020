## Notes

I have created a package called bezpy, which I make heavy use of here to manipulate all of the data. It can be found here, along with installation instructions: [bezpy](https://github.com/greglucas/bezpy)

For Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS) I created my own Python version of vectorized SECS: [pysecs](https://github.com/greglucas/pysecs)
